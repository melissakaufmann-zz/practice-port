        <p>Users were dropping off during the onboarding process, especially around the download and installation of a tool called the IDE. A tool that is essential for the platform’s workflow for solving labs.</p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>I worked with a product manager and our QA engineer to identify potential problem spots in the onboarding track, brainstorm solutions and then A/B test our proposed solution against the current track.</p>
      <h2>Identifying Potential Pain Points</h2>
      <p>We set a meeting to review the entire onboarding track. Our QA engineer was able to identify specific points in the process where users were dropping off. We hypothesized some users might be getting discouraged not knowing how many steps they had left complete or how long it would take them to get set up before they can actually start their course.</p>

        <h2>Adding Progress Indication</h2>
        <p>I started sketching out some ideas in high fidelity by modifying the existing UI for our lesson page. We already had some indication for progress for each lesson in the right rail. I tried some iterations that made the right rail persistent and added an addtional indication of progress at the track level.</p>

      <p>A persistent right rail with progress at both lesson and track level wasn’t working. It was overcomplicated and less clear when a student completed all tasks for a specfici lesson and were ready to move to the next.</p>

      <h2>The Next Iteration</h2>
      <p>In the next iteration I added a toggle to the right rail that enable students to flip the right rail up to see how there progress through the whole track and then flip it back down to complete the lesson.</p>

      <h2>Final Solution</h2>
      <p>The final solution was a widget that sat on top of the existing right rail. It can be toggled open to reveal all steps in the track. When closed ia progress bar still gives an indication of where they are in the track.</p>
