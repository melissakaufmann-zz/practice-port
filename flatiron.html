      <p class="project-subhead">Redesign of the Flatiron School’s marketing site. We needed to better incorporate the online web development program and help perspective students make informed decisions about which program is right for them. </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The existing marketing site was heavily focused on the in-person immersive programs and didn’t position the online program equally.
        We also needed to do a better job of helping students find information that would help them make a decision on what course was right for them. </p>

    <div class="project-text-col">
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>I collaborated closely with the design lead from the initial UX phase through to launc. I focused primarily on three informational pages: Events, Hire Our Grads and About Us.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="project-text-col">
      <h2 class="separator-small">Research and Wireframes</h2>
      <p>We held a series of informational meetings with internal stakeholders. The design lead also conducted a series of interviews with students and alumni to determine what criteria was important when assessing what coding bootcamp to attend. We found that most students heavily research programs before and want to know as much as possible about the program before making a decision. </p>
      <p>Based on this we made our pages dense and informational with as many oppourtunites for students to read and learn more as possible. </p>

       <h2>The Events Page Comp</h2>

        <p>The main focus of the events page is helping a user find an upcoming event quickly and easily. Events are listed in date order and can be filtered by in person or online. The event list was designed to be easily scanable with date and location information listed on the left and the registration link on the right.</p>

       <h2>THE ABOUT US PAGE COMP</h2>

        <p>The About Us page tells the story of Flatiron’s origin, mission and people. The graphic explaining the five values is meant to feel quintessentially Flatiron through the mix of brand blue, image overlays and the diagonal separators inspired by the logo. </p>

          <p class="test">We tried to merge the existing Flatiron School branding with the branding for the online learning tool, Learn.co.  Encorporated some of the Learn colors, brand greens and blue along with some of the UI elements.</p>
